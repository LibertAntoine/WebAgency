## Presentation
<p>
Simple web integration of a showcase site for a web company, from a Photoshop mockup. This site was made unique in HTML / CSS. The objective here was to respect the mockup as scrupulously as possible.
</p>
<p>
This project is an initiative resulting from my validation of knowledge carried out on Openclassrooms in 2018.
</p>
Realized in March 2018.
